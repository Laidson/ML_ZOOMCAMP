
# Description
The goal in this challenge is to predict the flight delays.

You should predict DELAY column. Here there are explanations for some data rows:


Data Features
1. Airline(Different types of commercial airlines)

2. Flight(Types of Aircraft)

3. Airport From

4. Airport To

5. DayOfWeek(Tells you about the day of week)

6. Time(Time taken.) departure time measured in minutes from midnight (in fact the range is 10-1439);

7. Length(Length of flight.) duration of the flight in minutes (I did some tests if it coincided with Skyscanner)

8. Delay(Time Delay)

Field	Name	Type
01	ICAO Code	String (3-4 chars, A - Z)
02	IATA Code	String (3 chars, A - Z)
03	Airport Name	String
04	City/Town	String
05	Country	String
06	Latitude Degrees	Integer [0,360]
07	Latitude Minutes	Integer [0,60]
08	Latitude Seconds	Integer [0,60]
09	Latitude Direction	Char (N or S)
10	Longitude Degrees	Integer [0,360]
11	Longitude Minutes	Integer [0,60]
12	Longitude Seconds	Integer [0,60]
13	Longitude Direction	Char (E or W)
14	Altitude	Integer [-99999,+99999] (Altitude in meters from mean sea level)
16	Latitude Decimal Degrees	Floating point [-90,90]
17	Longitude Decimal Degrees	Floating point [-180,180]


# EDA

* No presence o Null values
* DELAY - there is no such a difference among 0 and 1 values_count
    smaller time values have small delay.
    Time increase dalay increases
    Lenth and time similar distribution among 0 and 1 delay

    Airline - there one air line that represent highr number of delays (WN)

    DayOfWeek - aparently is not so influent over the delay

    Airport - the top 3 delay airport FROM and TO are:
        ['ATL', 'ORD', 'DEN']     


# Project Run
## create and starts a virtual env
### 1. install the project dependeces using:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 2. EDA analisys
you can follow the EDA analisys runid the Jupyter NoteBook 01_EDA.ipynb

### 3. Project runing
Project was organizer in 3 files at *src/* folder:

* `python src/stage_01_data_ingestion.py`
* `python src/stage_02_train_model.py`
* `python src/stage_03_tuning_model.py`

To get the model results you should run the files on the order, all the models and performances analisys are locaded on *artifacts/* folder.
